You'll need requests and sqlite3 installed to run the program. You'll only need to 
provide your own API key stored in a local file named "secret.txt"

The project has two tests to run. The first will validate that I query top 250 data
from the API properly. The second will create a dummy database and use my table
creation and population functions to fill the database.

The project passes all tests, but Github still can't seem to find the tests
